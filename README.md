# playground

This is a devcontainer quickstart to accompany the [kit-clj guestbook tutorial](https://kit-clj.github.io/docs/guestbook.html).  You can run it one of several ways:

## Clone this repo and start the devcontainer via VSCode and Docker Desktop

1. Clone this repo
2. Open your local copy in VSCode
3. Run the VSCode command `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container..`


## Quickstart Github Codespaces
If you have configured your Github account, you can start the project without any other setup.  It will open a web-based vscode editor backed by a Github Codespace VM. (Codespaces is Github's hosted Devcontainer solution)

## Running with a different editor

### IntelliJ

[IntelliJ devcontainer support](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html)

### Emacs, Vi, Cli

You can use the [devcontainer cli](https://github.com/devcontainers/cli) to start a devcontainer at the command line.  There are a number of ways to interact with it from emacs.  We are tracking this sort of usage [here](https://github.com/jwhitlark/cnc-devcontainer-templates/issues/3)

# Continuing with the Guestbook tutorial
Once you're running in a devcontainer, open a terminal and jump to [Creating a new application](https://kit-clj.github.io/docs/guestbook.html#creating_a_new_application) in the tutorial.
